# Docker-flask-monogoDB-Registration-Form-App
Built a Flask web application with MongoDB database integration, leveraging the power of Docker Compose.
The application Flask-MongoDB-Application is divided into frontend and backend.
Frontend has the HTML part and backend talks to the database for insertion/querying.

To run the application,
1) edit the variable MONGO in config.py (https://cloud.mongodb.com/ -> database -> ShradhaLearn cluster -> connect) 
You can see all the documents in the collections: https://cloud.mongodb.com/ -> database -> ShradhaLearn cluster -> Collections
2) docker-compose up
